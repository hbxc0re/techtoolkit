(might have to do as admin), reboot computer, and ping tests for google.com,
and yahoo.com to determine connectivity status.

made the installer silent, in other words there is no install dialog presented.
When clicked, the ats toolkit with extract the tools to c:\TOOLS automatically,
and then open the menu. 

there are 2 hidden options also (like the change log) they are 913 and 78
913 runs the windows for every tune up step automatically including disabling 
uac, opening the system properties window for adjusting virtual memory, running 
the reg tweak for faster shutdowns, clearing the event viewer, opening internet 
properties for browser reset, opeing "my computer" or "computer" in vista and 7, for 
disabling the indexing service, and runs msconfig.

78 runs tfc and ccleaner together...

and it wont open more than 2 at once, so you can finish settings for one and the 
next opens on the close of the first.

---------------------------------------------------------
changes from V1.4.9 to V1.5 Update Released On 12/31/12
---------------------------------------------------------

*Fixed 913 so that it waits for one thing to finish before starting the next. (tested on xp vista and 7)
I also removed the uac disable cmd window that says "the operation completed sucessfully" but it still does it and just closes. Also made the event viewer cleaner auto close when done cleaning.

Made the uac disable a quick flash rather than the user having to close the cmd window for it (this was the one that said the operation completed successfully)

Fixed something on the work completed options to make the menu close on it's own more often...

Made the windows xp file association fixes a zip file with reg files like the others rather than the crappy bat file that was not working too well.

Made the option that runs tfc and ccleaner at the same time "89" rather than 67. This is how they are on the menu...

add gcustom browser to files that get moved to c:\Advanced Tech Support for easier reconnects during escalations...this is useful when customer has no working browser or browsers lock up.

*added mouse emulator to c:\ as a hidden file. This allows a customer to use the number pad keys on the right side of the keyboard as a mouse if their mouse quits working...8, 5, 4, 6 as up down left and right, 1 for left click and 2 for right click...they can simply do a run box windows + R and type c:\mouse.exe to start the app...total size 28kb...

*completely removed 123 option and it's functions, due to the fact that the tdss part was still working and had no purpose.

*changed a few auto checked boxes in ccleaner per Edwin.
